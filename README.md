### Hi there! 👋 My name is Denisse Fierro Arcos 🤓🐱‍👤

***
I am a marine scientist from Ecuador living in Hobart/lutruwita, Australia. I am completing a PhD on a part-time basis at the [Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies](https://www.imas.utas.edu.au/). My project focuses on assessing the suitability of using a high resolution sea ice-ocean coupled model (ACCESS-OM2-01) to study the impacts of climate change on Southern Ocean ecosystems 🐧🐳  I work on a part-time basis as a Research Assistant for the [Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP)](https://fish-mip.github.io/) and my job here mostly involves working as a scientific software engineer, developing workflows to analyse large datasets. Previously, I worked with the Reef 2050 Integrated Monitoring and Reporting Program Data Management System (RIMReP DMS) project at [Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS)](https://imos.org.au/) developing scripts and delivering training showing how to use the DMS to researchers. I also worked as a shark researcher in the Galapagos 🦈🐠, as a environmental consultant in Perth, as a programming trainer online, and as a freelance data scientist. Over the years, I have been involved in a few publications and you can find them [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Denisse-Fierro-Arcos).

I am a `Python` and `R` progammer and I really enjoying writing scripts and help others develop their own. I am often involved in the organisation and delivery of workshops and hackathons in Australia and Latin America. I am a certified [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) instructor, I used to be involved with the [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/), [Datatas](http://datatas.com/), [OceanHackWeek](https://oceanhackweek.github.io/) but lately work commitments have limited the time I have available to contribute to these groups.

**Who am I?**
- 🔭 I am currently working on my PhD studying the effects of climate change on Southern Ocean ecosystems using a high-resolution ocean-sea ice model.
- 🌐 I work as a Research Assistant for the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (Fish-MIP), which seeks to understand the impacts of a changing climate on fisheries and marine ecosystems globally.   
- 🐟 I also develop [tools](https://github.com/Fish-MIP/FishMIP_extracting-data) for the [Fish-MIP](https://www.isimip.org/about/marine-ecosystems-fisheries/) to facilitate access to [ISIMIP](https://www.isimip.org/) data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about species distribution models in `R`.
- 🤓 I have recently started reviewing code for [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/).  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects studying the effect of climate change on ecosystems (if sharks 🦈 are involved even better). I am also interested in working in any projects related to open science, particularly if directed to Spanish speakers.
- 💬 Ask me about how to make nice plots with `ggplot2` (this is by far my favorite package), or how to find environmental data (observations or models) for ecological research.
- 📖 If you are interested in reading any of my [publications](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5039-6272) and you cannot access them, contact me and I will be more than happy to share them.
- 📫 How to reach me: [email](mailto:lilian.fierroarcos@utas.edu.au).
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun facts: I am a massive dog lover ❤🐕 and I am competent at many sports (running, swimming, cycling, climbing, free- and scuba-diving, kayaking, boxing), but I do not excel at any of them 😅
