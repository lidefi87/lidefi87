### Hi there! 👋 My name is Denisse Fierro Arcos 🤓🐱‍👤

***
I am a marine scientist from Ecuador living in Hobart, Australia. I have worked previously researched sharks and fishes in the Galapagos 🦈🐠 but now I am completing a PhD at the [Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies](https://www.imas.utas.edu.au/). My project focuses on assessing the suitability of using a high resolution sea ice-ocean coupled model (ACCESS-OM2-01) to study the impacts of climate change on Southern Ocean ecosystems 🐧🐳  I am also working as a Data Officer with the Reef 2050 Integrated Monitoring and Reporting Program Data Management System (RIMReP DMS) project at [Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS)](https://imos.org.au/). Over the years, I have been involved in a few publications and you can find them [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Denisse-Fierro-Arcos).

I am a `Python` and `R` progammer and I really enjoying writing scripts and help others develop their own. I am often involved in the organisation or delivery of workshops and hackathons in Australia and Latin America. I am involved with the [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/), [Datatas](http://datatas.com/), [OceanHackWeek](https://oceanhackweek.github.io/) and I am a certified [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) instructor.

**Who am I?**
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my PhD studying the effects of climate change on Southern Ocean ecosystems using a high-resolution ocean-sea ice model. I am also developing some [tools](https://github.com/Fish-MIP/FishMIP_extracting-data) for the [Fish-MIP](https://www.isimip.org/about/marine-ecosystems-fisheries/) to facilitate access to [ISIMIP](https://www.isimip.org/) data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Open Science and spatial analysis in `R` and `Python`.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects studying the effect of climate change on ecosystems (if sharks 🦈 are involved even better). I am also interested in working in any projects related to open science, particularly if directed to Spanish speakers.
- 💬 Ask me about how to make nice plots with `ggplot2` (this is by far my favorite package), or how to find environmental data (observations or models) for ecological research.
- 📖 If you are interested in reading any of my [publications](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5039-6272) and you cannot access them, contact me and I will be more than happy to share them.
- 📫 How to reach me: [@lidefi87](https://twitter.com/lidefi87) or [email](mailto:lilian.fierroarcos@utas.edu.au).
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a massive dog lover ❤🐕 and I am competent at many sports (running, swimming, cycling, climbing, free- and scuba-diving, kayaking, boxing), but I do not excel at any of them 😅
